| Muslim conceptions of pleasure and heaven 
| Veracity of scripture 
	- Bl. John Duns Scotus

|| Motivations of authorship 
	- lying for gain
	- exageration of certainity
	- the apostles were decieved
	- Insanity
	- Pseudo-graphicity
	- corruption of scriptures 

	- from this we must conclude the true authors of scripture are sane, certain, and
	  selfless men whose motivations can only be pure. 
		- Since the motivations are pure and reliable we must conclude they 
		  are of divine authority

|| Positive arguements
	- Conversion of many 
	- Prophecies 
	- coherence with reason and the nature of God
	- Miracles
		- Denial of supernaturality
		- Possiblity of demonic deception

|| Objections
	- supposed parallel
	- falsity of content
	- supposed incoherence with natural reason
		- morally outragous claims 

	- incoherence with prior revelation
