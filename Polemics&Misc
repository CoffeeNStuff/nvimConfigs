| Muslim conceptions of pleasure and heaven 

| Veracity of scripture 
	- Bl. John Duns Scotus

|| Motivations of authorship 
	- lying for gain
	- exageration of certainity
	- the apostles were decieved
	- Insanity
	- Pseudo-graphicity
	- corruption of scriptures 

	- from this we must conclude the true authors of scripture are sane, certain, and
	  selfless men whose motivations can only be pure. 
		- Since the motivations are pure and reliable we must conclude they 
		  are of divine authority

|| Positive arguements
	- Conversion of many 
	- Prophecies 
	- coherence with reason and the nature of God
	- Miracles
		- Denial of supernaturality
		- Possiblity of demonic deception

|| Objections
	- supposed parallel
	- falsity of content
	- supposed incoherence with natural reason
		- morally outragous claims 

	- incoherence with prior revelation 

| Veneration of Icons 

	- veneration principle - in the veneration of an image, the honor is not given to
	  the material image but rather the person depicted 
	- formal and material idolitary - although one could aledge one accidentially 
	commits acts of idolitary, to accidently commit idolitary is distinct. To formally
	do so one must intend to direct latria to an idol or its archetype 
|| Arguments For
	- Ark of the covenant
	- Solomon's Temple
	- Christ as a true image 
		- Christ Himself, in His incarntaion, shows the person of
	     The Son and in so allow His followers to worship the Godhead by the image of
		  his flesh

|| Arguments Against
	- Second commandment 
	- John's veneration of the Angel
	- Cornellius's veneration of Peter
