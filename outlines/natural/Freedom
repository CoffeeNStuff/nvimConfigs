| Preamble 
	- consequent of simplicity
		- immutability as a consequence of simplicity 
	- definition - God is totally actual, He posses no potency  to change from his 
		Eternal state of perfection
	- Denial of many modern philosphers on this grounds
		- Mullins, Schmid, 

	- Definitions of divine freedom 
		- God's absolute freedom is related closely with his omnipotence. His
		  omnipotence is the ability to do anything good, so His freedom like wise is
		  the ability to will without coercion. 
	 
| Motivations for Freedom
	- Multiple actions are compatible with God's essence, so it cannot be internally
	  necessary, and no other thing is prior or concurrent to God in order for
	  external neccesity, so His act is free; essentially no other thing can force God
	  to act so He must determine Himself
	- all motion of the will is twoards a final end but God's final TODO 

| Neccesity
	- St Bonaventure's division in Sentences and De Mysterio Trinitatae
	
| Divine freedom 
	- from the omnibenevolence
		% God can only do the best thing therefore He has no freedom to act otherwise

	- potency from choice
		% Freedom implies a multiplicity of options, that is, a potency to act this or
		  that way

		- Q.  


	- identity with will - will based modal collapse
		% The Divine will is identical with the essence, so the will must be necessary,
		  unchangable, and fully actualy therefore reducing all possibility for a
		  differing decree

	- identity of knowledge - knowledge based modal collapse
		% God's knowledge is internal to Himself and therefore identical to His essence,
		  if this is so His knowledge of what he decrees is necessary and cannot be
		  otherwise. Since His knowledge cannot be false, His decree must conform to 
		  His knowledge. So then, his decree is necessary and unchangable 

	- Trinitarian relations 
		% Love is a free action and the Word's and Spirit's proccesions are neccesary 
		  so the two are not compatible
