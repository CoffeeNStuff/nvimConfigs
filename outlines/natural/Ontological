| The argument

	- the predicate of non-existence is repugnant to the subject, to say 'God is not' is
	  to say 'pure being lacks being'

	- if the predicate is the definition of the subject the proposition is true, so
	  then to say, 'God is' is most true

| Objections to the argument 

| Objections to self-evidence

	- that which can be denied cannot be self evident 

|| Bl. Scotus
	+ Argument in favor: In saying 'God is' the predicate is the definition of the
	  subject, if the predicate is the subject then the truth is self-evident so the
	  God's existence fits the criteria of self-evidence. 

	- definition of a self-evident proposition
		- self-evident truth neccesitates self-evident terms 
		- "One that gets its evident truth from nothing outside the proper terms"
	   - consequnetly, it must be that one term is a self-evidently known term and the
		  other the very definition of the term 
	
	- the nature of terms and of concepts and definitions ? 
	- given the argument in favor, that since it is a neccesary per se truth it is
	  self-evident, it would follow any of these e.g. that 'man is a rational' is 
	  also

	- self-evidence still requires demostartion as the geometor proves 
	- self-evidently known and self-evidently knowable propositions 
		- self-evidently known propostiotions depend on at least one subject to
		  apprehend them whereas self-evidently knowable propositions are per se so

	~ Objection by the Doctor: The self-evident cannot be denied and  "The fool says 
	  in his heart there is no God"
