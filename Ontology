| Telology 
	- A telos is the end of a thing
|| Intrinsic Telology 
	- a things nature is objective, not merely a human abstraction 
		?? would nominalism destroy the objectivity of natural law
	- Ends are intrinsic to a nature
	- Natures can be deficient to these ends, called natural good and
	  evil
		- called 'natural good' and 'normative good' by Philippa Foot
		- non-moral goodness and badness of beavers with bad teeth enamal
		  or trees with retarted root growth
		- Artifical devices, like glasses, would not be evil since it 
		  furthers one's ends 
	- multiple uses of single organ 
		- other than its end vs. against its end 
			- A beaver's teeth squeaking when chopping wood, for example,
			  is not natural evil because it does not frustrate an end 
				- proximate and remote function
	- essence and proper accident 
		- rizzability, ability to laugh, is not essential but naturally
		  flows from rationality and passion, natural attributes
		- possibly blocked by defects, like brain damage or depression 
		- lacking a proper accident is not enough to discredit a nature 
			- the objection that not all humans seek friendship therefore
			  friendship is not essential is confusing nature and
			  proper accidents. Just because some specimens lack a faculty
			  does not discredit the genus having an end becasue of said
			  proper faculty 

|| Normativity of Telos
	- rationality inclies particular ends 
		- rationality is the ability to abstract and reason with forms 
		- jump from natural to normative good is because of rationality
		  and free will 
			- "What is natural in the normative sense is what is 
			  conducive to the realisation of the ends towards which a 
			  thing is directed given its nature. What is unnatural or 
			  contrary to the nature  is what furstratres the realisation
			  of those ends." 
			  'The Teleological Foundation of Human Rights', 135, Ed Feser
		- participation in social orders 
			- social bonds persist into adulthood, even when not needed 
			  for survival
			- PT, friendship, seeking the good of another, is an end of
			  humans, and the highest friendship is that between 
			  God and man
		- knowledge of God is highest to Aquinas

	- argument from divine intentionality: 
		I. to do contrary to Gods will is immmoral
		II. God intends on all on things their essence and exisence 
		III. In intending so he intends a prticular purpose or end for these things
		IV. so to use a thing contrary to its divinely decreed end is immoral 

|| Personal Thoughts 
	- Personal thought: the derivation of joy is a combination of the
	fulfilment of our ends and virtue, for example an apple sustains 
	one's energy.virtue also is necesary for this, as a malformed 
	conscience repudiates good. So in the beatific vision when one has 
	perfect virtue and perfectly fulfilled ends, full communion and 
	friendship with God, the greatest possible joy abounds. How then does 
	this impact the distinction between natural and supernatural joy, 
	i.e. Limbo vs Paradise

| Abstracta

	- Propositions 
	- universals
	- Essences 
	- mathematical objects

|| Nominalism 
||| Proofs 
	- Ontological Simplicity
	- limitaion of God's power
	- Interaction problems
		- Metaphysically
		- Epistimologically
	- Infinite regress of third-man-problem 
	- Vaugness problem 
	- boot strap problem of divine charateristics
|| Theistic Platonism / Divine Conceptualism 
||| Understandings
 	- Immitationism & exemplarism
	- Dyonsisian divine conceptualism
||| Proofs
	- Argument from Intentionality of Propostitions
		-	I. 	Neccesary truths exist
			II. 	Neccesary truths have always been true
			III. 	Neccesary truths are intentional
			IV. 	Intentionality requires a mind 
			=> therefore there is a eternal, neccesary mind 
		- Objections to premise III 
		- O 
			- if not, their meaning is indeterminate and lacking 
			  objective meaning, yet definitionally propositons,
			  numbers, &c. really determinatly describe concepts
		- mind independet intentionality 
			- Brentano's thesis is simpler and therefore preferable  
			- non-mental states cannot produce intentionality 
				- what material property makes objective intetention
				- varying interpitation
					- for example the emotions communcate by art & pictographs
				- TOREADOF  
		- human conceptualism is simpler
			- if these truths are neccesary they always exist, yet human 
			  minds have not thought them eternally, so we must conclude
			  abstracta that cannont fail to exist did not exist prior 
			  to humans conceving them
			  	- TOREADOF 
	- Inconrguency between platonism and aristotalianism  
		- dependecy of God's knowledge on uncreated forms
		- pre-existent of forms restrict providence 
		- Impossibility of being posterior to God
			- If God *is* being and all others things are participations then
				for abstracta to exist posterior is impossible 
	- Since nothing procceds God, what he knowns he knows through creating, hence all
	  his thoughts are really existent

	- A thougth is an image in the mind, an immitation of a particular. But God, in
	  seeing his own essence, has a singular act of comprehension of all things in
	  themselves since all participations are contained in the concept of being. A
	  perfect image is as similar as possible to its referent, and existence is a
	  possible means of imitaion, so then since God has a perfect understanding his
	  thoughts exist.
		- this ressembles S. Augustine and Bonaventure's beggoting through intelection
		  and will
		- what is contained in being is all the *possible* imitaions, so a perfect
		  image of them is not necessarily existent since its refernt is only possibly
		  existent
		- When God contemplates rational essences do the images have an intelect
		- When God contemplates material essences do the images have matter
||| Criticism
	- Contra per intention 
		- for God to be the origin of an abstracta, it must not exist prior 
		& since God cannot intend what he cannot concieve he cannot create
		these abstracta, therefore they cannot originate from a will 
			- Perhaps all forms implicitly n the dicine  nature, all positive
			  ontological beings are varying participations of being 
	- Contra per realations 
		- participation is a relation & regularly relations are between 
		  two objects yet if all of creation are relations 
	- Contra per Simplicity 
		- How can God be really simple yet have truly distinct concepts
		  in His mind
		  
	- Contra per distinction among abstracta 
		- God has a singular act of comprehension of His essence; all 
		  possible ways
			of participation  in being are konwn singularly
				- How can many concepts come from a single act of intellection 
				- If one in one act knew all combinations of red a blue one 
				  would know both lavender and magenta in a single act 
		- To summarize, God's singluar act of intelection, identical to his 
		  object of intelection, his essence, produces concepts conceptually
		  distinct, abstracta 

	- How is this distingushible from subjective conceptualism 
		- abstracta eternally (of course dependent and logically posterior 
		  to God) have being
		- a concept grasped by a creature is subjective, its filtered 
		  through influences of passions, intuions, and ignorance and 
		  results in an abstracted concept. Whereas a purely acutal being is 
		  not subject to these and furthermore knows things in per se 
		  therefore the concept is independent of subjects and purely 
		  objective
		- human concepts are only contigent existent, that is on a said 
		  human's mind. Wheras God's act of intelection is neccesary, so 
		  abstracta's existence is not contigent
		  		- does this apply to propisitions, if so then are all 
				propositions neccesarily true 
					- No, this confuses the propositions existence in God's 
					  mind and its truth
		- To summarize, they differ in that divine abstracta are eternal, 
		  objective, and neccesary 
		- is the jump from divine comprehension to being justified
			- Does this confuse existence and essence 
			- if mere knowledge of God confers being, all possible things 
			  exist of neccity and all matter
			  is in God's mind
			- CE, do humans thinking of abstracta cause them to exist
