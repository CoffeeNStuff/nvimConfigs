|| Formulations 
	- From the contraditiction in denial: 
		I.   when a predicate is identical to its subject the proposition is
			  self-evidently true
		II.  God is definitionally "infite being" 
		III. in the proposition "God is" the predicate is identical to the subject
		=> the existence of God is a self evident truth
	
	- From the greatness of God: 
		I.   God is that which no greater can be concieved
		II.  to have being in reality is greater is than to not
		III. so God must have being in reality 
		=> God must exist 

	- From possiblity:
		I.  it is possible that God,  a inifinite definitionally really existent thing, 
		    exists
		II. if its is possible that a really definitionally existent thing exist then it does
			a. proof: to be possible is to not contradict, to be definitionally really existent 
			   is to never fail to have being in reality, the concept holds then in
				reality is must be existent 
		=> God exists

|| Objections 
		~ muh island objection
			+ the nature of material things are that they are limited, an island can always have one more grain
			  of sand, and therefore could be greater and yeilds a contradictory, non-existent essence. this insight
			  can also be applied to any composite essense, because any composition demands a cause prior in order
			  to form its parts into one, but to be greatest is to be utterly first and independent so greatest possible 
			  thing must transcend composite essence's and be utterly simple
			  self-substitence

		~ 'Smallest really existent martian' objection
			% If existence can be taken as definitional of God one can construct a
			  parralell in which 'x' defined as 'a really existent thing of x's genre'
			  i.e the smallest really existent martian definitionally exists


		~ unmotivated modal shift 
			% anselms shifts from the conception of God "greatest concivable" to really
			  existent

		~ existence can not be predicated of an essence essentially
			% Kant's critique
		
||| Self-evidence
	- Bl. Scotus Ordinatio 1.2.2, para. 27, Simpson
		- self-evidence denies the possiblity of demonstration-why, yet we do have this
		  in God
		- We do not concieve the terms of his existence before we believe or know by
		  demonstration ? 
		- something to do with simplicity and conceptualizing unity ?
