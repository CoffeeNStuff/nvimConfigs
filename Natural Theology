| whether the exist of God is self evident and 'divine hideness'
	% self-evident, or as aptly indubitable, there is no lack of evidence, it itself,
	  in its proof, or in the intellect's apprehension.

|| Preamble
	- natural knowledge of God 

	- a indubitblily is evident in requires three elements: per se truth, proof , and apprehension. 
		- a truth is manifestly true in itself if 1) its predicate is its contained in its essence
		the denial incurrs a logical contradicition 

|| Defenses 
	-  Anselmian Ontological Argument
		% I. God is that which no greater thing can be concieved
		  II. existence is a thing which a greatest thing would have
		  III. therefore the essence of God is to exist 
		  IV. if a thing essentially exist, it must actually exist
		  V. God exist by definiton of his essence
		  VI. the existence of God is self-evident upon understanding its meaning

		~ there is no definition of greater provided
			+ to be greater is in refrence to limitaion, so that unlimited is meant by great

		~ II, muh island objection
			+ the nature of material things are that they are limited, an island can always have one more grain
			  of sand, and therefore could be greater and yeilds a contradictory, non-existent essence. this insight
			  can also be applied to any composite essense, because any composition demands a cause prior in order
			  to form its parts into one, but to be greatest is to be utterly first and independent so greatest possible 
			  thing must transcend composite essence's and be utterly simple 

		~ II, existence can not be predicated of an essence essentially

		~ IV, unmotivated modal shift 
		
|| Objections

	~ per se and quad nos distinction
	~ it is possible to concieve otherwise and is therefore not self-evident, at least quad nos
	~ obscurity of attributes identical to essence imply an obscurity of existence
	~ to conceive of God as that which no greater can be concieved requires positive knowledge, but 
	  God can only be known apaphatically 
	  	+ God can be known positively by negative knowledge. for example, his utter non-composition
		  including that of existence and essences
	~ if faith is manifest, faith would no longer be meritorius and, in fact, no longer even
	  properly called faith
	~ indubitible faith forces belief, whereas faith is a free action

|| Implications
	- whether the anselmian definition of God is properly promlegated

	- whether God can justly impose beleif in a self-evident truth

	- whether all disbeleif is a morally culpable failure, or that some are non-resistent non-belivers 

	- whether beleif in the dogma's of the faith are justly required

| Arguments against simplicity
	~ real Trinitarian distinctions without composition
	~ enetering composition in the incarnation  

	~ many attribute problem
	~ Eternality of the world 
		% if the act of providence is eternal then creation must be eternal,
		  but it is not, as is said 'in the beginning God created the heavens
		  and the earths'

	~ changing relations in creating
	~ changing relations temporal knowledge

	~ simplicity and knowledge
	~ simplicity and Augustinian realism

	~ Modal collapse from knowledge
	~ Modal collapse from intrinisic act
	~ Modal collapse from omnibenevolence 
	~ Modal collapse from alone world argument

	~ If God is existence, and things are composite of existence and essence, then God
	  must enter into composition

| eternality of the world
	 - definition 
	 	- a first item in temporal succesion 
		- a first actualization of potency, or equivilantly cause 
	
| Philosphical Polytheism
	- big lul

| 2nd stage argument from limits
	- numeric and degree limitations  
	- what is infinity 
		- as St. Bonaventure says it is a fullness without superfoulesness 
			- perfect communication is exaustied in the trinity
				- intelect & volition
				- dilectio and condilectio
				- any further proccesion would be less perfect and undermind the 
				  principle of the reduction, namely that perfection is limitless
|| Proofs 
|| Criticism 
	- is trinitarianism proccesions a limit
		- Neccesity of exactly 2 proccesions 
			- St. Thomas
			- Koons and mental analogy 
	- is logic a limit 
		- logic describes being, God is being, ergo God preceeds logic;
		  God is logically prior to logic
