| whether the exist of God is self evident and 'divine hideness'
	% self-evident, or as aptly indubitable, there is no lack of evidence, it itself,
	  in its proof, or in the intellect's apprehension.

|| Preamble
	- natural knowledge of God 

	- a indubitblily is evident in requires three elements: per se truth, proof , and apprehension. 
		- a truth is manifestly true in itself if 1) its predicate is its contained in its essence
		the denial incurrs a logical contradicition 

|| Defenses 
	-  Anselmian Ontological Argument
|| Objections

	~ per se and quad nos distinction
	~ it is possible to concieve otherwise and is therefore not self-evident, at least quad nos
	~ obscurity of attributes identical to essence imply an obscurity of existence
	~ if faith is manifest, faith would no longer be meritorius and, in fact, no longer even
	  properly called faith
	~ indubitible faith forces belief, whereas faith is a free action

|| Implications
	- whether the anselmian definition of God is properly promlegated

	- whether God can justly impose beleif in a self-evident truth

	- whether all disbeleif is a morally culpable failure, or that some are non-resistent non-belivers 

	- whether beleif in the dogma's of the faith are justly required

	-  Anselmian Ontological Argument, Infinity 
		% I.   There is infinite being and finite being 
		  II.  There is not potency in Infinite being 
		  III. Possible Existence is potency		  
		  IV.  So an Infite being must exist, else it is not infinte
		  V.   The infinite neccesarily existing being is what men call God
		  VI.  If a predicate is contained in the subject's essence it is
		       self-evident  
		  =>   The existence of God is a self-evident truth
		  
	-  Anselmian Ontological Argument, Aseity
		% I.   God is that which no greater thing can be concieved
		  II.  Existence is a thing which a greatest thing would have
		  III. Therefore the the greatest thing essentially exists 
		  IV.  If a thing essentially exist, it must actually exist
		  V.   God exist by definiton of his essence
		  VI.  If a predicate is contained in the subject's essence it is
		       self-evident  
		  =>   The existence of God is a self-evident truth
		   
		~ there is no definition of greater provided
			+ to be greater is in refrence to being, so that infinite being is
			convertible with greatest 

		~ II, muh island objection
			+ the nature of material things are that they are limited, an island can always have one more grain
			  of sand, and therefore could be greater and yeilds a contradictory, non-existent essence. this insight
			  can also be applied to any composite essense, because any composition demands a cause prior in order
			  to form its parts into one, but to be greatest is to be utterly first and independent so greatest possible 
			  thing must transcend composite essence's and be utterly simple 

		~ II, existence can not be predicated of an essence essentially

		~ IV, unmotivated modal shift 

		~ to conceive of God as that which no greater can be concieved requires positive knowledge, but 
		  God can only be known apaphatically 
			+ God can be known positively by negative knowledge. for example, his utter non-composition
			  including that of existence and essences
			+ In the proof we do not seek to grasp wholly the divine essence, rather
