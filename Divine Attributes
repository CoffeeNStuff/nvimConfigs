	- compostional causal priniciples 
		- priority of parts to their whole
	- from argument from motion 
	- from universal conservation
		- God conserves and gives being and form to all things, but to do so He must
		  have all things since one cannot give what he does not have. 

||| Thelogical
	
	- unlmitedness
		% I. God is unlimited
		  II. anything really other than God is limited
		  III. to have limited parts is to be limited
		  => God cannot have any quality other than his substance or composition at
		  all 

		~ III. Man is both material and immaterial, so two contrary qualites exist in
		  one substance so can limitation and unlimitation
		~ III. divinity can remain unlimited and yet united with limited parts as a man
		  can remain rational but united with irrational parts 

	- eternality 
		% I. God is not limited by temporal moments just as He is unlimited by spatial
		     limitations, so He must be outside of time, all things simultanious, 
			  namely eternal. 
		  II. For an attribute to be, it must either receive existence from something
		      prior or have existence of itself
		  III. there is nothing prior to eternity
		  IV. So anything eternal cannot recieve, but must have intrinisic, its 
		      existence, therefore any eternal attribute is self-existent
		  IV. Only that which is really identical to divinity is self-existent
		  => All of God's attributes are really identical to his essence and hence simple

		~ IV, the persons of The Trinity recieve existence but are also eternal
			+ The divine persons are identical to their existence, and their existence
			  is self-existence. So each person is eternally self-existent. 
				~ In What sense can we say The Sons recieve divinity from The Father
					+ The persons Son and Spirit recieve what they have, but are identical
					  to their reception. They eternally recieve and are just as babe is
					  both son, brother, and human simultaniously.

		~ IV, The persons of The Trinity eternal but seem really distinct from the essence
			+ The Persons of the Divine Trinity are only virtually distinct from the
			essence and really distinct from on another, and thus each eternal

		~ IV, What precludes another being self-existent
	
|| Objections 

||| Seeming composition 
	- real Trinitarian distinctions without composition
	- enetering composition in the incarnation  
	- If God is existence, and things are composite of existence and essence, then God
	  must enter into composition

	- simplicity and knowledge
	- simplicity and Augustinian realism

	- many attribute problem
	- argument from beauty 
		% beauty is consequent of composition and God is beautiful so God must be
		  composed
		~ only in material things is beauty from proper comoposition. a creature is
		  greater with greater composition because it must gain through composition
		  what it does not have essentially, but God is essentially beautiful

||| Freedom

	- From divine freedom
		% if God has the freedom to choose one way or another, he has a potency to to
		  act one way or another, therefore there is a composition of act and potency

	- Modal collapse from knowledge
	- Modal collapse from intrinisic act
	- Modal collapse from omnibenevolence 
	- Modal collapse from alone world argument



| Immutibility 
|| Arguments for
||| Philosphical 
 
||| Theological 
	- immutable perfection 
		% I. God's essence is most perfect as his essence is perfection. 
		  II. Any quality greater than God's perfection is a contradiction
		  III. Any quality as perfect to God's perfection can only be identical to His
		       essence, becuase if it were perfect God is already essentially so
		  IV. So any quality other than the divine essence is imperfect
		  V. God cannot posses anything that contradicts His essence, so He can have no
		     imperfection 
		  => God posses no quality distinct from His essence 
|| Objections
	- changing relations in creating
		% God is at once not creator and then is, he is at once able to create the
		  world and then can't posterior to its existence already attaining
		~ this lacks a fundumental distinction, that is, between God and God's effects.
	     While creation changes from and to existence, God is static in his 
		  providential act. Similarly the second objection confuses a change in the 
		  power to create and the allowing conditions changing. 

	- Eternality of the world 
		% if the act of providence is eternal then creation must be eternal,
	     but it is not, as is said 'in the beginning God created the heavens
	     and the earths', so God is composed of an agent and act
		~ God's act of providence is eternal but their effects are temporal	

	- temporal location from temporal knowledge
		% there exists a class of propostional knowledge of what is true *now*, that is
	     in the current moment, for example the statment 'the sun is shining now.' If
	     these propisitions considered exist and God knows all, He must be in time to
	     know these 
		~ this a dumb objection lul 
		~ an obvious parralel is spatial knowledge, that is the
	     knowledge 'the tree is to my left' or first person predications like 'I am
	     material.' For God to fullfil this parrallel He must be matterially present
	     everywhere, but this is absurd so this objection mus fail. the knowledge
	     considered in this objection is the subjective experience of objective 
		  knowledge. God does know all occurence and their exact temporal location, 
		  but God knows reality not through experience but by causation, thereofore God
		  nows the same propositions without temporal constrains.
