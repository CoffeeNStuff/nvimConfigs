	- from Primacy
		% Any composite is composed by a prior being, but none is prior to God, &c.

	- From pure actuality 
		% Any given part has potency to not be united or be united differntly, but in
		  God there is no potency &c.

	- Essential perfection 
		% I. God's essence is most perfect as His essence *is* perfection. 
		  II. Any quality greater than God's perfection is a contradiction
		  III. Any quality as perfect to God's perfection can only be identical to His
		       essence, becuase if it were perfect God is already essentially so
		  IV. So any quality other than the divine essence is imperfect
		  V. Any part would be other than the essence and therefore imperfect
	     => In God there are no parts 
	
|| Objections 

||| Seeming composition 
	- real Trinitarian distinctions without composition
	- enetering composition in the incarnation  
	- If God is existence, and things are composite of existence and essence, then God
	  must enter into composition

	- simplicity and knowledge
	- simplicity and a multiplicity of divine ideas

	- many attribute problem
	- argument from beauty 
		% beauty is consequent of composition and God is beautiful so God must be
		  composed
		~ only in material things is beauty from  comoposition. a creature is
		  greater with greater composition because it must gain through composition
		  what it does not have essentially, but God is essentially beautiful

||| Freedom

	- From divine freedom
		% if God has the freedom to choose one way or another, he has a potency to to
		  act one way or another, therefore there is a composition of act and potency

	- Modal collapse from knowledge
		- Modal collapse from alone world argument

	- Modal collapse from intrinisic act

| Immutibility 
|| Arguments for
||| Philosphical 
 
||| Theological 
	- immutable perfection 
		% I. God's essence is most perfect as his essence is perfection. 
		  II. Any quality greater than God's perfection is a contradiction
		  III. Any quality as perfect to God's perfection can only be identical to His
		       essence, becuase if it were perfect God is already essentially so
		  IV. So any quality other than the divine essence is imperfect
		  V. God Does not change essentially, so all change would be accidential 
		  VI. Accidential change implies a charachteristic other than perfection
		  VII. God can have no imperfection,so He cannot posses anything other than His essence
		  => God posses no quality distinct from His essence 

|| Objections
	- changing relations in creating
		% God is at once not creator and then is, he is at once able to create the
		  world and then can't posterior to its existence already attaining
		~ this lacks a fundumental distinction, that is, between God and God's effects.
	     While creation changes from and to existence, God is static in his 
		  providential act. Similarly the second objection confuses a change in the 
		  power to create and the allowing conditions changing. 

	- Eternality of the world 
		% if the act of providence is eternal then creation must be eternal,
	     but it is not, as is said 'in the beginning God created the heavens
	     and the earths', so God is composed of an agent and act
		~ God's act of providence is eternal but their effects are temporal	

	- temporal location from temporal knowledge
		% there exists a class of propostional knowledge of what is true *now*, that is
	     in the current moment, for example the statment 'the sun is shining now.' If
	     these propisitions considered exist and God knows all, He must be in time to
	     know these 
		~ this a dumb objection lul 
		~ an obvious parralel is spatial knowledge, that is the
	     knowledge 'the tree is to my left' or first person predications like 'I am
	     material.' For God to fullfil this parrallel He must be matterially present
	     everywhere, but this is absurd so this objection mus fail. the knowledge
	     considered in this objection is the subjective experience of objective 
		  knowledge. God does know all occurence and their exact temporal location, 
		  but God knows reality not through experience but by causation, thereofore God
		  nows the same propositions without temporal constrains. 

||| Freedom 
	- potency to act otherwise
		% If God has the power to act one way or another than His will has potency
	- identity with will
		% If God is identical with His will and His will is mutable then He is mutable
	- changing Knowledge/Alone world 
		% If knowledge is dependent on the current reality and God knows all truths
		  then His knowledge must change in relation to reality in order to believe
		  truth
