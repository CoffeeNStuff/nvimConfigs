| Intelecualism and voulantrism 
|| Intelectualism
	- the intelect apprhends the good and the will is an apetive power 
|| Voulantrism
	- the will causes the will to act
		~ a thing causing itself is absurd
			- the possibliity is evident by the example of God's will. a first thing must 
			  exist and this first thing must be self causing, therefore self causation is 
			  possible, not in the sense that a thing can cause its own existecne this is truly
			  absurd, but in the sense it can cause its own actions
		~ a thing must be pure act to cause itself
	- the intelect is a natural power, in that its consequence neccesarily follows
	  from its nature; the intelect cannot but understand. the will is a rational power and can
	  choose between goods
	- a habit is an inclination to do so; for example to breath is habit, it is formed by actions 
	  and even persists outside of the doing of action of willing the habit

||| Intetionality 
	- Indetermacy of meaning of matter
	% Matter offers no objective specification of refrence yet thoughts 
	  are objectivly about what they describe. so then thoughts all conatin
	  a certain aboutness 
		~ a mere cognitive association theory of meaining is simpler thoughts
		  are merely recalling sense data 
		~ the statment 'Men are mortal' doesn't have 'aboutness' so some thoughts 
		  are not intenional 
		~ Lingustic tokens can offer 'aboutness' 
			+ yet aboutness is not intrinisic to the letters, rather they are in 
			  the perception of the reader so that intetniality is inspired but not
			  contained in a word, this is certain by anaylisis of varying interpitations
			  and linguistic considerations
