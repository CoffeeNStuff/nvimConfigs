| Purgatory 
	- necesity of purity to enter hevean
	- distinction of temporal guilt 
		- the faithfuls' role in purgation i.e indulgences & prayers &c. 
	- is purgation necesary from God's justice
		- fitting and necesary
	- temporality in purgatory 
	- corporiality in purgatory
	- whether the remission of sins in purgation is by the purged's works
		- God's decree of mercy and justice on the purged is atemporal and therefore
		  able to be considered even if the faithful pray after the purged is beatified 

| Beatific vision 

	- are there passions in paradise 
		- what is the signifcance of the new body 
	- whether the blessed have pity on the damned
	- whether hevean entails a lack of free will 
	- whether there are immmediate goods other than God in heaven 
	- whether heaven would eventually be boring

|| Thomistic
|| Scotist
|| Palamite
	- only see essential energies
	- corporeally visible, example of the transfiguration

| Universalism
% That to choose hell is coherent with the nature of freedom 
	~ for the will to act freely it must act rationally, and to act rationally
	  with proper information is never to choose hell or in anyway otherwise than heaven
		+ A person can act culpability even when not fully rational if there lack of
		  raitionality is from a prior action. for example drunk driving one loses
		  rational judgment but is consequent of a prior moral action. 
		+ ones will is not coerced by the intelect, if it were all culpability and
		  freedom is destroyed. knowledge is determined by prior actions and knowledge
		  coerces so therefore this would entail a coerced will. if one is not the
		  source of their actions they are not culpable therefore this colapse also
		  destroys moral culpability
		 	~ If so explain then one can fall from heaven and repent from hell 
	
% That God's decree  that some will be damned is cohernt with his good will for all men
	~ It is the will of God that all men recieve their highest good, namely their salvation, and
	  the will of God is never impeded so the salvation all men must obtain eventually
	~ God's good will is to prevent human suffering so to not perserve the existence of an unfaithul 
	  soul for eternal torment is incongruent, yet they cannot attain hevean so to the anhiliate the
	  soul is most congruent with Gods good will

% That damnation is a just punishment 
	~ A punishment must be poportionate to its offense, yet unfaith is finite and hell infinite 
	  and therefore unjust
		+ an offense is porportionate to its wrong, but to not give what is due to the
		  greatest good is to do the greatest evil, therefore the action is infinitely
		  evil 
		+ those in hell continue to sin and so are in merit constant punishment, since
		  their will is fixed and persists in sin eternally their actions merit an
		  eternal punishment

	~ The primary purpose of punishment is repentance and perfection, yet those damned cannot be 
	  perfected so their punishment is grotesque and contrary to God's good will
	  
% That the damned cannot repent
	- 3 proofs for the immutibility of the soul after death 
		- Reality C. 44, SCG IV, C. 91 - 96, 
		- Cajetan 
		- Scotistic 
	~ those of purgatory can refrain and no relevant difference is found between the two 
	  therefore the damned can repent
	~ if the will of the damned and blessed are not free they cannot hate and love
	  respectivly, but if the will is free then to repent is a possible action,
	  therefore the damned can repent

| Intersession of the blessed 
	- the saints are alive in heaven 
		-> the saints pray  
	  -> the saints are most holy in heaven
	  -> the saints are aware of the militant church
	  -> it is licit to ask for anothers prayers
	  -> it is useful to ask for anothers prayers

| Veneration of the saints
	- how can the saints percieve the prayes of the faithful on earth
		- since God's essence is identical his knowledge (all knowledge) in gazing upon the 
		  essence in its fullness, the blessed can percieve the created word
