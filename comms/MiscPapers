| Schmid  & Feser on existential inertia and causal principles

|| Overview
	- Feser adopts a strong dependency on sustaining & concurrent causality
		;; could these arguments be reforumulated without this 
		;; relation to scotus' concurency principle in De Primo
	- use of per se dependency chain upon the assumption they must have a primary member
	- Schmid supposes absloute simplicity is incompatible with mindedness and The Most
	  Blessed Trinity 
	- Schmid seems to posit that causal principles of composition and movment are
	  primarly motivated by explicability rather than primarly positive arguments

|| Neoplatonic Proof
	- Schmid says Feser's argument for part-whole dependency doesnt prove metaphysical dependency
	  but merely shows a necessary condition for the whole 
		- possibility of a whole to ground its parts as in 'neo-classical theism' and
		  tropes 
		  - grounding is distinct from efficent causation, rather it is a mere
			 explaining
	- Contrary accounts of compositional grounding offered
		- metaphysical neccessity could ground unity (14) 
			~ seems ad hoc and not preferable 
			~ still demands an explination, mathematical truths can be further explained
			  dispite their necessity

		- a most fundumental part of God grounds his accidental properties 
			- two types of wholes, one constituted by the unity of its parts
		     and anothter in which  part 'a'  can ground the unity of 'b' and 'c'. if taken in
		     the former then for a whole to unite its parts is contradictory. under the
		     latter, supossedly the neo-classical theist can assert a unity of parts in
		     God in which his fundumental part grounds some accidental properties or parts
	- Mindedness
		- no proper reason to assume mindedness, A Plotinian One is a possible
		  alternative
			~ intential action seems to necessitate a mind and the act of creation is
			  intential 
	- abstracta 
		% innconsitent triad: 
			I.  Abstracta (of any kind) exists necessarily
			II. Abstracta are distinct from God
			III. anything distinct from God requires his free creative sustinance

		 - denial of II via divine conceptualism 
			- if numbers 2 and 7 are identical to God, then God must be both even and
			 odd 
				- elaborated on in Joes discussion of divine conceptionalism on Parkers
				  Pensees 
				- similar to God's simplicity & knowledge  
				~ perhaps, two concepts can be same in reference but distinct in ratio,
				  possible parallel responses to the 'many qualities' argument
			- if x (any concept) is composite and x is intrinsic to y (God) then y is 
			  composite
	- Trinitarianism 
		- Schmid says the possesion of a indivuating feature entails composition (22)
		- Schmid confuses the affirmation of everyones total divinity & simplicity 
		  with a total agreement in features (22 p. 2) 
			- absolute and relative (esse in et esse ad) quality distinction
		- Schmid calles the Godhead a composition (23) and thus subjects it to a
		  need for a concurrent, sustaining cause of unity

|| Aristotalian Proof
|| Aristotalian principle
	- the two theses are modal equal in commitment, epestemically agnostism is
	  default (3, 1) 
		- therefore EEP demands a justification 
	- EEP demands immediate anihilation not merely decay 
	- response to counter examples
		- violinist, music is arguabably a procces and ceasation is not instantanious
		  as the aristotalian prinicple requires 
		- radioactive decay, decay is also gradual and is likely from enviormental or
		  internal causes, not a tendency to existentailly expire
