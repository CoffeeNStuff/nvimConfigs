| On Not Three Gods, St. Gregory of Nyssa
|| Unity of nature 
	- responding to counter-example of Ss. Peter, James, and John being three seperate
	  men despite sharing one nature, questions how the Godhead is properly called One 
	- demostrates the unity of all humans qua their humanity and their division by
	  personhood
		- "But the idea of the persons admits of that separation which is made by the
		  peculliar attributes considered in each severally ... yet their nature is one" 
		- "but in its essence being and continually remaing one ... not divided with
		  the individuals who participate in it" 
	- singularity in nature in the Godhead
	- the divine nature is ineffable, the terms used are always peculiar 
||| Persoanl Thoughts
	- What makes one thing seperate from another 
		- Nature or matter, since The Godhead is connatural and void of matter the
		  distinction of persons in no way divides into many God's 
		- God's proccesions distinguish the persons only, so all charteristics are
		  common expect for cause, as in the Athinasian creed
|| Unity and singularity of operations in the God head
		- "let him consider this operation, and judge whether the power extends
		  throughout the Three Persons"
		- "For Scripture attributes the act of seeing equally to Father, Son, and Holy
		  Spirit, David says, "see O God our defender" and from this we learn that to
		  see is a proper opration of the idea of God"
		- "But in the case of the Divine nature we do not similarly learn that the 
		  Father does anything by Himeslf which the Son does not work conjointly, or 
		  again the Son has any special operation apart from the Holy Spirit; but every
		  operation which extends from God to creation ... has its origin from the 
		  Father and proceeds through the Son and is perfected in the Holy Spirit for
		  this reason name derived from the operation is not divided with regards to the
		  number of those who fullfill it." 
		- "for the name derived from operation cannot be divided among many where the
		  result of the mutual operation is one" 
	- monotheism is perserved by 1) singularity of nature 2) Inseperable operations
|| Proccesions in the Godhead
	- consubstaniality does not confuse the persons 
		- "[W]hile we confess the invariable charachter of the nature we do not deny
		  the differnce in respect of cause, and that  which is caused by which alone
		  we apprehend that on Person is distinguished from another" 
	- The Son is directly from the Father and the Spirit is from the Father by/through
	  the son 
		- "One is the Cause and another is of the Cause and again in that which is of the
		  Cause we recognize another distinction. For one is directly from the first
		  Cause and another by that which is directly from the first Cause" 
	- expounds meaning of proccession and cause with a horticultural anology 
		- differnce between *what* a tree is *how* the tree was planted 
||| Personal thoughts
	- all anaologies are imperfect as St. Gregory has said. The imperfection of this
	  analogy is temporality and the corpereality. 
		- God existence unrestrained all things simultanious, although contrary to
		  natural understanding all things are eternal there is no time when the Father
		  only or the Father and Son exist alone. there is no start and progression in
		  God only completion
		- the fact the of matter in a tree shows a seperation and if over literally the
		  Godhead head would truly be three, but since the planter and planted are
		  immaterial and connatural there is a unity 
	- Compatibility of proccesions with simplicity
		- how could a proccesion exist ? 
			- the definition: the total giving of divinity without the multiplication
			  of Gods (without the multiplication of substances)
			- to extend the analogy, a tree growing from another's seed is one in nature
			  yet distinct in origin. Even if the tree's grow to be identical in there
			  size, shape, number of branches &c. they are not identical in origin and
			  therefore distinct. Again this must consider the insufficency of material
			  anaolgies 
			- Augustinian analogy  

| On Not Three Gods, Boethius 
	- what makes things different 
		- by form, either genus of species
		- number, accidential properties 
	- Since God is form without matter he is neccesarily one 
	- Strong Divine Simplicity, identity of being with essence in God 
		- "the form whic is pure form [God], which is very Being" 
		- "But other things are not simply their own essences, for each things has its
		   being from the things of wich it is composed" 
	- abstract and concrete terms
