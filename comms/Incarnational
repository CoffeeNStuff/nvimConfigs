| On The Incarnation Of The Word

	- narrative of salvation offered
		-> Man is created in God's image
		-> Man freely corrupts his image which was made for eternal love
		-> God seeks to reedem man because He loves His handiwork
		-> Insufficency of mere natural repentance 
		-> Christ is emboddied 

	- the purpose of the incarnation was, "that the Lord should both make haste to
	  help us and appear amon men", and, "For of His becoming Incarnate we were the
	  object" (4.2-3)

	- God desired to give us eternal life in order that we be more perfect images of
	  Him, (4.5-6) 
		- Quotes Wisdom 2:23
		- the image of God is to have the pure perfections of God in a participated
		  way whereas God is so in an unparticipated sense. heaven is the fullfillment
		  of this, and our having perfection by participation creates a great love
		  between us and our Source, since from God we recieve all things, similarly to
		  God we return all things

	- Mere natural repentence is insufficent because it only calls back from action
	  whereas the very nature of man has been corrupted 
	  	- What is meant by natural corruption? Perhaps the lose of eternal friendship,
		  but I dont see why this natural rather than personal
	
	- Imcarnation perserves God's immutible perfection and embraces humanity fully

	- God's decention apeals to God's lower faculties as well, He does this to bring
	  back even those who have abandoned reason
