| On The Incarnation Of The Word, St. Athinasius

	- narrative of salvation offered
		-> Man is created in God's image
		-> Man freely corrupts his image which was made for eternal love
		-> God seeks to reedem man because He loves His handiwork
		-> Insufficency of mere natural repentance 
		-> Christ is emboddied 

	- the purpose of the incarnation was, "that the Lord should both make haste to
	  help us and appear amon men", and, "For of His becoming Incarnate we were the
	  object" (4.2-3)

	- God desired to give us eternal life in order that we be more perfect images of
	  Him, (4.5-6) 
		- Quotes Wisdom 2:23
		- the image of God is to have the pure perfections of God in a participated
		  way whereas God is so in an unparticipated sense. heaven is the fullfillment
		  of this, and our having perfection by participation creates a great love
		  between us and our Source, since from God we recieve all things, similarly to
		  God we return all things

	- Mere natural repentence is insufficent because it only calls back from action
	  whereas the very nature of man has been corrupted 
	  	- What is meant by natural corruption? Perhaps the lose of eternal friendship,
		  but I dont see why this natural rather than personal
	
	- Imcarnation perserves God's immutible perfection and embraces humanity fully

	- God's decention apeals to God's lower faculties as well, He does this to bring
	  back even those who have abandoned reason

| On Not Three Gods, St. Gregory of Nyssa
	- responding to counter-example of Ss. Peter, James, and John being three seperate
	  men despite sharing one nature, questions how the Godhead is properly called One 
	- demostrates the unity of all humans qua their humanity and their division by
	  personhood
		- "But the idea of the persons admits of that separation which is made by the
		  peculliar attributes considered in each severally ... yet their nature is one" 
		- "but in its essence being and continually remaing one ... not divided with
		  the individuals who participate in it" 
	- singularity in nature in the Godhead
	- the divine nature is ineffable, the terms usesd are always peculiar 
	- unity of operations
		- "let him consider this operation, adn judge whether the power extends
		  throughout the Three Persons"
		- "For Scripture attributes the act of seeing equally to Father, Son, and Holy
		  Spirit, David says, "see O God our defender" and from this we learn that to
		  see is a proper opration of the idea of God"
		- "But in the case of the Divine nature we do not similarly learn that the 
		  Father does anything by Himeslf which the Son does not work conjointly, or 
		  again the Son has any special operation apart from the Holy Spirit; but every
		  operation which extends from God to creation ... has its origin from the 
		  Father and proceeds through the Son and is perfected in the Holy Spirit for
		  this reason name derived from the operation is not divided with regards to the
		  number of those who fullfill it." 
		- "for the name derived from operation cannot be divided among many where the
		  result of the mutual operation is one" 
	- monotheism is perserved by 1) singularity of nature 2) Inseperable operations
	- consubstaniality does not confuse the persons 
		- "[W]hile we confess the invariable charachter of the nature we do not deny
		  the differnce in respect of cause, and that  whihc is caused by which alone
		  we apprehend that on Person is distinguished from another" 
	- The Son is directly from the Father and the Spirit is from the Father by/through
	  the son 
		- "One is the Cause and another is of the Cause and again in that which is of the
		  Cause we recognize another distinction. For one is directly from the first
		  Cause and another by that which is directly from the first Cause" 
	- expounds meaning of proccession and cause with a horticultural anology 
		- differnce between *what* a tree is *how* the tree was planted
