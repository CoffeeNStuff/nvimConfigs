| Book of Causes, Aquinas
|| 1 - 18 Causal Dependency
	- A cause is greater the more fundumental it is, shows through formal cause 
	- A primary (more remote) cause can act independent of its poseterior (more
	  proximate) causes
	- the first act assits the second, remote act effects a thing via the proximate
	  act
	- the power of a second act is given by the first and therefore the power given to
	  the object is caused by the first as the first cause is the objects ultimate
	  origin
	- the remote cause is greater by the proximate 
	- the dependence of the second on the first shows a need for the first to
	  contiually cause, since power in the second is given only by recieving it must
	  continually recieve to continually give, else it would have none more to give
	  (premise 17) 
	- Aquinas applies Proculus' principle to formal, material (33-36), efficent 
	  (34-38 ), and final (39 - 42)
	- all causes are per se ordered twoards God but per accidens ordered to their
	  respective proximate objects
