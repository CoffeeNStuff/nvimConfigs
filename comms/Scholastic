| Book of Causes, Aquinas
|| Causal Dependency 1 - 18
	- A cause is greater the more fundumental it is, shows through formal cause 
	- A primary (more remote) cause can act independent of its poseterior (more
	  proximate) causes
	- the first act assits the second, remote act effects a thing via the proximate
	  act
	- the power of a second act is given by the first and therefore the power given to
	  the object is caused by the first as the first cause is the objects ultimate
	  origin
	- the remote cause is greater by the proximate 
		- the dependence of the second on the first shows a need for the first to
		  contiually cause, since power in the second is given only by recieving it must
		  continually recieve to continually give, else it would have none more to give
		  (premise 17) 
		- since finite being is given to be sustained a thing must continually be given
	- Aquinas applies Proculus' principle to formal, material (33-36), efficent 
	  (34-38 ), and final (39 - 42)
		- all causes are per se ordered twoards God but per accidens ordered to their
		  respective proximate objects

| De Primo Principium, Duns Scotus 
|| Division essentially ordered series 
	- order is to be taken as priority and posteriority

- Essential orders
 - Emminence
 - Dependence
  - from a third, common cause	
	- the posterior flowing proximatly through the prior
	- the prior flowing immediately from the common yet essentially after the prior ?
  - the posterior from the prior
	- final
  	- efficient
	- material
	- formal 

||| First Division, Eminence & Dependency 1.6
	- Eminency
		- priority in form 
		- act as prior to potency
	
	- Dependency 
		- the prior can exist without the posterior but not the converse 
		- called priority of substance and species, called merely depedency

||| Second Division, Causal Dependency 1.9 
	- further division of dependency
	- A posterior can either be cause by its prior or both be caused by a third thing,
	  the prior more proximatly and the posterior more remotely
		- cause from the posterior 
			- must be related 

		- cause from a third, common cause 
			- when a subject has a dual effect and the second depends on the first 
			- the creation a subject e.g. matter and  its qualities e.g. shape
			- two proofs of essential order, firstly the aforsaid maxim and secondly
			  that the remoter i.e. posterior relies on the proximate for the act
			  supplied by the source 

||| Third Division 1.13
	- subdivision of both of subdivisions

	- subdivision of third, common cause
		- A (e.g. shape) is said to be posterior to B (e.g. matter) if A is in no way
		  the cause of B yet share common causallity with A yet more proximatly than B
		- 

	- the posterior from the prior 
		- final, efficient, material, & formal

|| Analysis of Division 
||| Three Conclusions against self-causation
	- Nothing is essentially ordered to itself 2.2
		- nothing can be more emminent than itself
		- as for dependency, nothing can depedn on itself
		- both cases lead to the concurrent existence and non-existence of a thing 

	- An essential order can't be cirular 2.4
		- contained in the first conclusion 
		- would lead to a member being both the prior and posterior of another
		
	- What is subsequent to a posterior is subsequent to the prior 2.6
		- posterior relies on the prior for causality 

||| Six Conclusions Concerning The Cause and its Effect's Relations 
	- Whatever is not ordered to an end is not an effect 2.9
		- All effects have an efficient cause, whatever has efficient cause has final cause
		- The Minor can be proved by the intentionality of all intellectual agents and
		  also of non-intellectual agents as proven by Aristotle 
		- It can also be proven by the primacy of final causality
			- final causality does not depend on anyother cause
				- matter depends upon final, final on efficient, &c. 
			- efficient causality depends on final causality, as an efficient cause
			  forms matter according to the cause's end 

	- Whatever is not an effect is not ordered to an end 2.14 
		- final cause demands a member essentially prior to efficiently cause,
		  therefore the uncreated is not ordered to another 
		- the end of a thing is not always identical to its last operation or the
		  object thereof

	- What is not an effect is not made of matter 2.19
		- Matter is a principle of potency and neccesitates a prior cause to be formed
		  but there is no cause to the first therefore &c.
		- to have matter one needs a material cause, matterial cause is posterior to the 
		  other three causes, the first principle lacks the procceding three causes,
		  therefore &c. 
		- composition is dependent on a prior unity, form and matter is composition
		  therefore &c.

	- what is not made of matter is not formed 2.23
		- what is immaterial is not composed of essential parts because it is
		  essentially one and parts are potency 

	- what is not caused by extrinsic cause is not caused by intrinsic cause 2.26
		- intrinisic is posterior in extrinsic cause
	
	- the four causes are essentially ordered in causation to one & the same thing 2.29
		- sufficiently explained in the sixth conclusions four and six
