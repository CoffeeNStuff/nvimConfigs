| Preamble 
	- consequent but not identical with simplicity
	- definition - God is totally actual, He posses no potency  to change from his 
		Eternal state of perfection
	- Denial of many modern philosphers on this grounds
		- Mullins, Schmid, 
| Motivations for simplicity
	- God is pure act, he poses no potential to change
	- To change is to mantain substance and change accident, implying composition
	  which is repugnant to God
	- The added quality is either 1) more perfect, but God is perfection and has no
	  greater 2) is equal, but if the quality is perfect God already Has it 
	  essentially or 3) is a lesser quality, but God Has no imperfections and 
	  imperfection can accidentially coexist with an essentially perfect substance

| Motivations for Freedom
	- Multiple actions are compatible with God's essence, so it cannot be internally
	  necessary, and no other thing is prior or concurrent to God in order for
	  external neccesity  

| Problems and resolutions
	% Freedom implies a multiplicity of options, that is, a potency to act this or
	  that way

	% The Divine will is identical with the essence, so the will must be necessary,
	  unchangable, and fully actualy therefore reducing all possibility for a
	  multiplicty of options
