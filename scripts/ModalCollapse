| Preamble 
	- consequent of simplicity
		- immutability as a consequence of simplicity 
	- definition - God is totally actual, He posses no potency  to change from his 
		Eternal state of perfection
	- Denial of many modern philosphers on this grounds
		- Mullins, Schmid, 

| Motivations for Freedom
	- Multiple actions are compatible with God's essence, so it cannot be internally
	  necessary, and no other thing is prior or concurrent to God in order for
	  external neccesity, so His act is free; essentially no other thing can force God
	  to act so He must determine Himself

| Modal collapses 
	- potency from freedom
		% Freedom implies a multiplicity of options, that is, a potency to act this or
		  that way

	- identity with will - will based modal collapse
		% The Divine will is identical with the essence, so the will must be necessary,
		  unchangable, and fully actualy therefore reducing all possibility for a
		  differing decree

	- identity of knowledge - knowledge based modal collapse
		% God's knowledge is internal to Himself and therefore identical to His essence,
		  if this is so His knowledge of what he decrees is necessary and cannot be
		  otherwise. Since His knowledge cannot be false, His decree must conform to 
		  His knowledge. So then, his decree is necessary and unchangable
