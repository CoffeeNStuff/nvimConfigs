| definitions 
	- total non-composition
|| 4 forms of composition
	- materialiality, creatures are made of parts while God lacks these
	- essence without accident
		- essence = nature =\= form 
		- human nature is the definitional, or essential properites, of a human
		  a soul and a body 
		- accidents are potency
		- accidental properties are those that can change without changing *what* a
		  thing is, for example a man can be 100 pounds or 110 pounds while still being a man
		- God does not have these he is only his nature without changing or changable properties
	- act and potency
		- potency is possibility act is what is currently so, what has existence
		- for example, God does not have ponential locality, he is omnipresent
		- God is immaterial, matter inherently has mass, location, extension which are non-essential
	- essense and existence

|| some implications 
	- 'divine nature', 'divine essence', divinity, &c. are used but know there not like creaturly 
	  essences, His is 
	- his qualities are identical to eachother
		- since a nature is a group of properties and he lacks a nature but rather is pure existence
		  all conceptually different properties refering to the same real thing, existence
		- we can distinguish his mercy and justice in our minds, yet in reality
		- different in concept but not reality
		- only divided in expression but identical in reality
		- this inability to see its reality in its fullness causes confusion, perfected in 
		  the beatific vision, salvation
			- motivation for essence energies distinction 
		  	- this is why the palamite view is heretical, they suppose we only see essential activites
				- in palamism, an essential activity is something distinct from God's essence but is
				  must exist because of it. for example God is perfect love, so he must love the other persons
				  but this love is not God. 

| motivations
	- fourth laterean council
	- western saints, Ss. Augustine, Thomas Aquinas, and all other mediveal and post-mediveal catholics
	- composition requires a cause, things tend twoards disjunction so composition is caused
	- De ente 
		- an essence is distinct from existence. a unicorn has essence, *whatness*, but not existence. so an
		  essence must receive its existence from another, dogs are not self causing. this can be traced back
		  to a thing who does not recieve existence but does supply it. this thing is not composite of essence 
		  and existence, its essence, if can be called that, is existence, it must self-exist 
		- because God has no essence really, but is existence, he properly speaking has no qualities he is just existence.
		  the plurality of qualities is only so upon *touching* an intelect
	- divinity is the highest perfection, so any composition or accident would defintionally be a lower good and so to enter 
	  composition with would be imperfect
		  
| consequences
	- Gods qualities are identical
	- all that God has is merely is his love being expressed in differing ways
		- even is love is existence itself, quite confusing
	- essence energies distinction is eliminated
	- basis for latin theology
